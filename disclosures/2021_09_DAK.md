# Responsible disclosure of sensitive data exposure found at DAK-Gesundheit (a German statutory health insurance) in September 2021

## Abstract
It was possible to get unauthorized access to the name of an unknown person having a statutory health insurance at the DAK-Gesundheit (a German statutory health insurance company) and find out his or her date of birth. This was possible because the workflow for uploading a photo for the electronic health card (eGK) allowed access by simply guessing the personal insurance number combined with a preview of the card that contained the name of the person associated with it.


## What was initially detected by me?
In Germany, we have an electronic health card (eGK) we use as proof that we have a statutory health insurance. This card contains a picture of the owner so it is easier to detect potential misuse. Since someone's appearance changes over time these pictures must be updated from time to time.
In September 2021 I received a letter from my insurance (DAK) that it was time to send them a new picture. They provided three possibilities:

1. Upload it inside the browser
1. Send a new picture in a letter
1. Upload it at a special so called [health terminal](https://www.dak.de/dak/kontakt/gesundheitsterminals-2103358.html#/) of the DAK that can be found at several public places

I decided to use the browser-upload at https://www.dak.de/bildupload since it seemed to be the fastest and easiest way. When I read the instructions on how to do it and executed the steps, I got alerted:

1. To get started I just needed to enter my personal insurance number that is printed on the eGK. This enabled me to upload a new picture and I got a preview which contained my name. 
1. To finalize the upload I needed to enter my date of birth to authenticate myself.

This means:
By guessing identification numbers it would have been possible to any potential attacker to find out the name of the owner of an eGK that is insured at the DAK. By guessing the date of birth it would have also been possible to attackers to
   1. find out the date of birth of the affected person.
   1. change his/her picture without being truly authorized to do so.

This also means that someone who was already in possession of such a combination would have been able to change the image of that person.


## So what did I do?
On Monday (06.09.2021), right after detecting this, I wrote a mail to the team responsible for data privacy at DAK, explaining what I found and suggesting two improvements:

- As hotfix to keep the service available I suggested to at least request the date of birth together with the identification number in the beginning of the process. This would make it harder to find valid combinations, especially if it is taken care that in case of partially correct inputs it is not revealed which part is the wrong one.

- As long time solution I suggested to provide people who need to update their picture a one-time key. That way, even someone who has the knowledge of the identifier and the birth date of a person wouldn't have the possibility to change the image.

Since I did not receive more than an automated answer that day, I made a phone call the next day (07.09.2021) to ensure the right people would get notified quickly. Few hours later I got a first answer that confirmed my finding, saying they immediately started working on it. Later the people at DAK that were responsible for making the application more secure and I also had a phone call. I was told that

- they planned to rollout a hotfix at 09.09.2021. This hotfix contained:
  - The date of birth was requested right in the beginning together with the personal insurance number to make number guessing more difficult.
  - The real name was no longer displayed on the preview. A generic sample name was shown instead.
- they planned to do an additional penetration test until 15.09.2021
- they reported that potential data leak also to the responsible regulatory bodies
- they will plan additional long-time improvements
- even if someone would manipulate the image of somebody, this would not endanger the insurance cover since there are multiple fallbacks. One of these would be that the DAK can send a certificate of insurance directly to e.g. a doctor if needed.

After that we also coordinated the responsible disclosure of the leak.


## Are the fixes applied sufficient?

I'm not able to fully test it in the productive system since my last image upload was just a few days ago. What I can verify is that the date of birth is asked in the beginning *after* the identification number. According to information provided to me from the responsible persons at DAK:
In case someone enters a wrong identification number in the first step of the dialog presented to a user or a wrong date of birth in the second, an error message is shown, presenting multiple possible causes.

=> So there is a countermeasure, preventing potential attackers from easily determining whether they made a right guess for one of the numbers.

Additionally, if a user is allowed to upload an image, the preview no longer contains the true name of the associated person but just a placeholder that is the same for each and every one.

=> So personal data is being hidden from potential attackers even in case they make a right guess.

In case an invalid combination of identification number and date of birth is entered more than 5 times, the WEB-API will deny any request for the identification number for half an hour.

=> So there is a counter-measure, slowing down potential attackers. But how effective is it?

According to [krankenkasseninfo.de](https://www.krankenkasseninfo.de/zahlen-fakten/lexikon/krankenversichertennummer) the personal insurance number starts with an uppercase letter followed by 9 digits. So there are  ![26*(10^9)](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=26*10^9) possible identification numbers. According to [statisa.com](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/856392/umfrage/groesste-gesetzliche-krankenkassen-in-deutschland-nach-der-versichertenzahl/) about 5,600,000 people were insured by DAK in 2020. Assuming randomly guessed numbers, there's a change of 1:4643 to guess an existing identifier. According to [statisa.com](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/37220/umfrage/altersmedian-der-bevoelkerung-in-ausgewaehlten-laendern/) the average age of people in Germany was 45.7 years. Simplifying a year to have 365 days, this would be an average lifetime of 16681 days. So the chance to guess someone's day of birth can be assumed to be 1:16681. So the likelihood to guess a valid combination is ![1.29*10^-8](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1.29*10^-8).

Assuming

- that someone knows a valid identification number but not the date of birth of a person
- and that guessing itself takes no time
- and someone needs ![16681/2=8341](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=16681/2=8341) guesses to find the right date of birth

it would take ![(8341/5 tries)*30 minutes=34.75 days](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(8341/5)*30=34.75) days to just get the access needed to upload an image. This should be enough time to recognize an attack and take additional countermeasures. As mentioned in the section above, according to information provided by DAK, it would not endanger the insurance cover of a person, if an attacker would be able to upload an image.

The possibility that someone knowing the number and the date of birth of a person uploads an image without being authorized to do so still exists. According to information from DAK in this case this doesn't endanger the insurance cover of the insured person, so there's just the financial risk for the DAK that they produce an electronic health card with a wrong image. This is not as good as it could be considering the state of the art. Hopefully, the additional long-term improvements announced by DAK will take care of this minor issue, too.
