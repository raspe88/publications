## What was initially detected by me?
While investigating some timeouts in my home network using [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), at Sunday, 24.01.2021 by accident I saw a strange link being called from my wife's computer having the structure

`http://elearning.blak.de//login/index.php?username=XXXXX&courseid=XX&date=XXXXXXXXXX&token1=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&token2=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

which really alerted me. An `http` connection to some login page passing something that looked like credentials?


## Where did it came from?

[BLAK](https://www.blak.de/), that's the "Bayerische Landesapothekerkammer" (approximate translation: Bavarian Chamber of Pharmacists).
As it showed up, my wife participated in an online training on a [Moodle](https://moodle.org) based system. After talking to her, I detected this:

Members of the "Bayerische Landesapothekerkammer" use https://www.fortbildung-blak.de to register for online trainings. After having registered successfully, they can enter the training by clicking a button inside that portal. The link associated with that button had the structure I detected:

`http://elearning.blak.de//login/index.php?username=XXXXX&courseid=XX&date=XXXXXXXXXX&token1=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&token2=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

Clicking that link automatically performs a log in of the user into the eLearning system. After successful login, the user is redirected to the page of the correct course. This last redirect uses an `https` connection again.

It was just a small effort by comparing links to multiple online trainings to verify:

- `username`: was always the username of the user for elearning.blak.de, which is not always equal to the username for https://www.fortbildung-blak.de, e.g. in case a name changed because of a marriage.
- `courseid`: was the identifier of the course at https://elearning.blak.de and was used to redirect the user to the correct course. The link used for that redirection after a successful autologin matches the pattern https://elearning.blak.de/course/view.php?id=XX 
- `date`: contained the unixtime in seconds of the point in time when the page containing the link was delivered to the user
- `token1` and `token2`: only contained the numbers 0-9 and letters a-f and had a length of 32 signs. This e.g. would be exactly the length of the hexadecimal representation of an (insecure) [MD5 hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hash_functions).
  - `token1`: seemed to be constant per course and independent of `date`
  - `token2`: changed with each update of the page at https://www.fortbildung-blak.de. Considering the parameter `date`, I got afraid there could be a connection between these two parameters that could be refactored. It seems that this token is just valid for a short time period and can just be used once.


## Summary in between

- Users had been redirected from https://www.fortbildung-blak.de to http://elearning.blak.de, passing credentials in an unencrypted way. This would allow a [man-in-the-middle attack](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Man-in-the-middle_attack).
- In case `token2` was calculated from other information contained by such a link, an attacker would maybe be able to refactor that. This way it would be possible to get unauthorized access by a [broken authentication](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A2_2017-Broken_Authentication) mechanism to https://elearning.blak.de, maybe even for a user having admin permissions.
- The server at http://elearning.blak.de did not reject the login trial received on an unencrypted connection. Using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) I verified that there was no redirection from http://elearning.blak.de to https://elearning.blak.de//login/index.php before successful authentication. This indicates that the [configuration of the server](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A6_2017-Security_Misconfiguration.html) was not as secure as it could be. In best case, all unencrypted authentication requests would be rejected.


## So what did I do?
At Monday (25.01.2021) morning, I called the telephone hotline of BLAK. Although they could not tell me an official IT security officer, I was advised to get in contact with the responsible IT project manager.

His **response was very quick**. At 11:30 o'clock I had a remote meeting with him. I explained the problems found and he reproduced them by himself. Additionally I recommended to introduce static code analysis tools to search for similar issues and to check the server configuration.

He promised to tackle the findings and we exchanged my notes documenting those. We agreed on a responsible disclosure for end of March 2021, since the BLAK had already hired an additional employee to take care of IT security who would start working in February. This should give them enough time to check their systems. In case of additional critical findings, we agreed, that it would be possible to defer the disclosure.


## So what did the BLAK do?
The BLAK kept me up to date about what was happening: After an internal analysis they changed the link containing the credentials to start with  `https`, to prevent Man-in-the-middle-attacks. This was a cheap, quick and efficient solution to prevent Man-in-the-middle-attacks and make it harder to outsiders to collect data that would empower them to potentially refactor the `token2`.
I was able to verify that this change has been done.

During this verification I noticed, that the session cookies of https://elearning.blak.de/ and https://www.fortbildung-blak.de missed the `HttpOnly` flag. Additionally, the `Secure` flag was not set and the `SameSite` attribute was set to `None` - a dangerous session cookie configuration that would potentially allow [session hijacking](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_hijacking_attack) by [XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/), [CSRF](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) and again potentially [MitM](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Man-in-the-middle_attack). I reported this finding back to the BLAK.

Regarding the other topics, the IT project manager promised to keep them in mind and think about solutions, if necessary.


## Are there any open topics?

I do not know:

- whether the data contained by the link needed for authentification could be refactored by an external attacker or at least `token2` was calculated by a secure mechanism. According to the BLAK the analysis is still ongoing. Currently they see no possibility for an attack from the outside based on the generated links.
- when it is exactly planned to harden the session cookies. The IT project manager of the BLAK promised to do so. State of 05.04.2021 the fix has not been rolled out.
